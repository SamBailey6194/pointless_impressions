#### Unselected Keywords

**Short-Tail Unselected Keywords:**
- **Cheap art online:** Implies low quality and devalues the artwork; goes against our value of "Quality."  
- **Discount art:** Similar to "cheap art," it suggests a focus on price over artistic merit.  
- **Art sales:** Too generic and can attract bargain hunters rather than collectors interested in quality.  
- **Paintings for walls:** Overly utilitarian and doesn't convey the artistic value or uniqueness of our offerings.  
- **Home art:** Similar to "paintings for walls," it lacks the sophistication we aim for.  
- **Print art:** While we offer prints, this term can be associated with mass-produced, lower-quality items, which isn't our primary focus.  
- **Art deals:** Again, emphasizes price over quality and artistic integrity.  
- **Buy artwork:** While accurate, "buy art online" is more specific to our e-commerce platform.  
- **Gallery online:** Less specific than "online art gallery" and might not capture the B2C focus.  
- **Abstract art:** While we may feature abstract art, it's not our primary niche, and "pointillism art" is more targeted.  

**Long-Tail Unselected Keywords:**
- **Cheap pointillism art for sale online:** Similar to the short-tail "cheap art online," this implies a focus on low price over the artistic value and quality we aim to represent. It could attract customers looking for bargains rather than genuine art enthusiasts.  
- **Discounted abstract paintings for living room:** Again, the term "discounted" goes against our brand's emphasis on quality and the inherent value of art. "Living room" is also overly specific and utilitarian, not aligning with our focus on unique art as an investment or passionate acquisition.  
- **How to get free art online:** This keyword attracts individuals seeking freebies, which is not our business model and directly contradicts our goal of selling curated artworks.  
- **Art sales events near me:** This is a geographically specific search, which doesn't align with our initial online-only B2C model. It also focuses on "sales events" which again suggests a price-driven approach rather than an appreciation for art.  
- **Mass-produced art prints for office decor:** This keyword implies a focus on generic, mass-produced items, which is the opposite of our curated, unique, and often original artwork offerings. "Office decor" is also too utilitarian.  
- **Beginner art projects pointillism:** While we offer educational content, this keyword specifically targets individuals looking for DIY projects, not necessarily those looking to purchase finished artworks from established artists.  
- **Where to find art deals online:** Similar to "art deals," this emphasizes finding bargains rather than investing in quality art, which contradicts our brand values.
